In today's digital age, safeguarding sensitive healthcare data is paramount. 
Our approach introduces an advanced framework that combines multi-authority access control with anonymous authentication,
revolutionizing the protection of personal health records. By distributing access control across multiple authorities,
we enhance the security of data by minimizing vulnerabilities. 
Simultaneously, the implementation of anonymous authentication guarantees the confidentiality of user identities,
ensuring a high level of privacy during data transactions. 
The proposed method uses Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) cryptographic technique that allows access control based on specific attributes of users and
enables anonymous authentication while preserving the privacy of sensitive health information.
